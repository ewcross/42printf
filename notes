to do:

		- add resizing function to c and s converters
		- c gets wint_t
		- s gets wchar_t
		- could make both return wchar_t but then need to change all processing
		  funcitons to handle that
		- test what happens with write function - should maybe work with char
		  but should only write first char of a wchar_t string
		- change function which writes var string to write correct
		  number of bytes (sizeof(wchar_t)) or sizeof(wint_t)
		- return value is always +1 for any char
		- for char - if value is more than 255, return -1;
		- this value is returned instead of writing the block, e.g:
				- "hello...%d---%lc...there", 5, 256
				  gives "hello...5" and -1 return (only prints %d block)
