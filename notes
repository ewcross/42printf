to do:

		- c gets wint_t if l present and stores in list element
		- s gets wchar_t if l present and stores somewhere
		- test what happens with write function - should maybe work with char
		  but should only write first char of a wchar_t string
		- change function which writes var string to write one wint_t if
		  str spec being processed and wide_str_found is 1
		- return value is always +1 for any char
		- this value is returned instead of writing the block, e.g:
				- "hello...%d---%lc...there", 5, 256
				  gives "hello...5" and -1 return (only prints %d block)

return values:

		- to return -1 - return 0 from write_output
